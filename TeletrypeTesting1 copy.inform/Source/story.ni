Include Inanimate Listeners by Emily Short.

Hamshack is a room. 

The teletype is an addressable device in the hamshack.  "Humming, the teletype is available." The description of the teletype is "The printing on the a paper says: Connection established.  Endpoint: HAL 9000.   Message: Hello, I am HAL 9000.  You may talk to me directly.  Proceed."

Understand "HAL 9000" and "HAL" as the teletype.  

Instead of asking the teletype about "coordinates": say "'Our coordinates are 3,4,5.'"

Instead of telling teletype about "coordinates": say "'Space is surprisingly small,' you tell the HAL. [paragraph break]'Parse not found,' the HAL complains."

Test me with "ask HAL about coordinates / tell HAL about coordinates / HAL, n ".
