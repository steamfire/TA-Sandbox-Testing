[Example of how to do the same name for things in different rooms, but still be able to customize each one separately]  [The secret is the ONE term]

A mountain is a kind of thing. The description of a mountain is usually “It’s a mountain.”

Valley is a room. “A mountain looms over you to the west.” One mountain is in valley.  It is fixed in place. The description is "the mountain is blue here".
Foothills is west of the valley. “You are almost at the mountain.” One mountain is in Foothills. The description is “You can see that the mountain is unclimbable. Might as well turn around.”

Test me with “x mountain/w/x mountain/w/x mountain”.
