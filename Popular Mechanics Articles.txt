Camping Gear Reviews
  Outdoor activities far from power lines and modern[line break]
  conveniences have brought back many "old-time" appliances for[line break]
  campers, boaters and others. Now you can buy a wood or[line break]
  coal-burning cast-iron stove, just like Grandma used to use,[line break]
  only better. The compact little stove stands only 10 inches[line break]
  high, is 18 by 13 inches square and weighs 40 pounds. It'll[line break]
  burn any kind of fuel, from logs and coal to patent chemical[line break]
  fuels, and an optional attachment will rig it for oil. For[line break]
  boaters, it has a top railing to keep pots and pans from[line break]
  sliding off in rough seas. It's made by Washington Stove[line break]
  Works, Box 919, Everett, Wash. [line break]
  
  Another convenience for outdoor living in a new compact form[line break]
  is the little 6 or 12- volt electrical water-pressure system[line break]
  being made by Grover Products Co., of 1233 South Hope St., Los[line break]
  Angeles 15, Calif. The motor and pump don't take up any more[line break]
  space than half a loaf of bread, but they'll put running water[line break]
  in a car or boat with instant. automatic pressure without[line break]
  a pressure tank, and will supply up to six faucets. The[line break]
  gadget will work as a bilge pump or bait-tank circulation[line break]
  system, too.[line break]
  
  Fishers and bird-watchers can learn to spot their quarry[line break]
  by sound with a new 12-inch long-playing record of fish and[line break]
  bird noises that comes with the book Animal Sounds and[line break]
  Communication, published by the American Institute of[line break]
  Biological Sciences, 2000 P. St. N.W., Washington 6, D.C.[line break]
